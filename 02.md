What you need to before you start building your container image:

.Net Core
  - https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/dotnet/hello-world-tutorial/intro
 
 Docker
  - https://docs.docker.com/install/
  
  
  Step one is to create a folder and put this repository in it : https://github.com/skjohansen/SimpleWebHalloWorld.
  When you've done that you'll want to install docker and restart your computer.
  
  Issues/ Problems, 
  If you can't start the Docker Desktop application, you can try these steps:
  1. Go to "apps and features" in windows. Then in the upper right corner you'll press Program and features.
  2. Next step is to click on "Turn windows features on or of" in the upper left corner. 
  3. Choose Hyper-v and disable. Then restart on request. 
  4. Previous steps but instead of disable hyper-v you'll want to enable it again.
  
  This should help with not able to start Docker desktop.
  
  
  Now you'll want to navigate to the SimpleWebHalloWorld folder.
  1. Open a new file called Dockerfile
    1.1 In Terminal enter code Dockerfile
    1.2 Paste this:
    FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet:3.1 AS runtime
WORKDIR /app
COPY bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/publish/ .
ENTRYPOINT [ "dotnet", "SimpleWebHalloWorld.dll" ]
    1.3 Don't forget to save the file.
    
 2. Now you want to actually build the docker image.
  2.1 In the console enter: docker build -t myapp .
  2.2 Next is to run following command : docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name MyNetApp myapp
  2.3 If you want to list all the running containers enter "docker ps" in the terminal.
 
 3. open your browser and go to: http://localhost:8080/ And you should see the SimpleWebHalloWorld be running.
 
 
 
CODE in Dockerfile:
`FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet:3.1 AS runtime
WORKDIR /app
COPY bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/publish/ .
ENTRYPOINT [ "dotnet", "SimpleWebHalloWorld.dll" ]`


CODE in docker-compose.yml
`version: '3'
services:
    web:
        build: .
        ports:
            - "8080:80"`
            
Måste kolla upp mer vad exakt som ska stå i ports delen men detta funkar...
